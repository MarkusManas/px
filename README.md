NOTES:

My answer to the 1st test question is 3. The user model will be updated with the provided first_name, last_name and email
parameters.

additional notes: 
    - failed to implement cancancan, did not have time to learn new gem, implemented my own crude authorization process.
    - failed to properly show messages after user create on users/new, inserts into db properly.
